- Led a project (“Digitômetro”) independently to maximize the percentage of digitally signed operations by bankers within Santander Corporate Banking.
- Systematized the database of all corporate banking operations by developing scripts in SQL for data treatment of manually inputted data and automatizing the generation of cleaned data to then have it processed in Tableau for weekly reports; estimated 15\% OPEX reduction with digitally signed operations at 95\% (49.5\% as of August 2021)
- Developed a model to measure productivity among corporate bankers and consolidated its region-specific limitations into the assessment-structure by organizing meetings with bankers from all 9 regional branches in Brazil.
