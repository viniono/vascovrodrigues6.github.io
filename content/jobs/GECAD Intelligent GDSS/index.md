- Collaborated with a three‑person team in an Argument Mining Doctorate project which lead to the application of Artificial Intelligence to the Group Decision Making context.
- Applied Named‑Entity Recognition pre‑trained models for Alternative Detection as a baseline results for the model we developed for the project, achieving an accuracy of 75‑80% on the existing dataset.
- Experimented with multiple Clustering techniques in addition to Dimensionality Reduction techniques and proper Data Treatment and Preprocessing to dynamically organize conversations. The experimentation methodology and its’ results were published in MDPI, in the [Applied Sciences journal](https://doi.org/10.3390/app122110893).
- Co-author of a paper accepted in the 2022 edition of WorldCIST (Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis Annotation Methodology for Group Decision Making Problems: An Insight on the Baseball Domain) and published in [WorldCIST 2022: Information Systems and Technologies](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-04819-7_3).
