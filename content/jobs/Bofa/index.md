- ETF/Portfolio Products Trading: 
    - Developed a Bayesian model to predict the replacement of Vonage Holdings (NASDAQ:VG) from the S\&P 600 in July 2022, due to Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC) recently announced acquisition. 
    - Model sorts for securities that minimizes the impact in the index by looking into historical adds/drops from the Standard and Poor’s in 2022, considers the most under-weighted sectors in the S&P 600 relative to the TMI and uses Bayesian theory to estimate likelihoods based on historical data from 1 year past.

- US Mortgages Trading
    - Responsible for weekly research morning note summarizing previous week’s flow in the agency and non-agency MBS space to assist traders on better understanding the overarching macro theme of the MBS market.
    - Worked closely on CMO (Collateralized Mortgage obligations) structuring, more specifically Front sequential with extension profiles of less than 7 years. 
    - Identified a trading opportunity in Bofa’s MBS inventory and pitched a Freddie Front sequential bond (FHR 5239 EB), which then was actually traded the morning after my pitch.
