I always had an interest for Mathematics and Technologies. I knew since the early days, that this was the journey I wanted to take in my Education. Had my first contact with programming in the last year of high school and since then I lined my objectives into learning more from it. 

Joined ISEP and finished my Bachelors in Computer Software Engineering (2017-2020). Decided to continue my journey in Computer Software Engineering: Information and Knowledge Systems Masters at ISEP (2020-2022) since it explored a wide range of fields like Data Science, Statistical Theory and Methods, Artificial Intelligence and its' different applications, Deep Learning, Data Engineering, Simulation, DevOPS. I was distinguished with Merit Award and 2nd best overall in my MSc.

Some of the projects done in Masters degree can be seen in the Other Noteworthy Projects in the Projects section and this was my MSc [dissertation](dissertation.pdf).

Here is a list of skills I have!
