I'm a data science and financial engineering enthusiast with a strong background in Machine Learning. I approach my work with an entrepreneurial mindset, seeking innovative solutions at the intersection of these fields.

I graduated from Grinnell College in May 2024 with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Economics, concentrating in Statistics. I am now working as a Quant Strat for a credit systematic trading pod at Bank of America, focusing on investment-grade (IG) and high-yield (HY) credit, and based in New York City.
